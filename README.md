# Javascript Crash Course
Following some tutorials from Javascript crash course produced by Traversy Media.

# Concepts
The format for this section will follow along the lines of what the topic is, followed by what I learned.

### What is javascript
- Javascript is primarily a scripting language, most present in web development
- It is weakly typed like python
- It can be used as a backend (Node.js)
- It can be used frontend (React.js, Vue.js, Tensorflow.js)

### Variables
- There are several ways you can instantiate variables (let, var, const)
- const does not change and must be assigned a value from its inception
- let can be modified
- var is globally available and for this reason is not recommended
- There are also several types of variables (str, number, boolean, null, undefined)
