# Javascript Crash Course
Following some tutorials from Javascript crash course produced by Traversy Media.

# Concepts
The format for this section will follow along the lines of what the topic is, followed by what I learned.

### What is javascript
- Javascript is primarily a scripting language, most present in web development
- It is dynamically typed like python
- It can be used as a backend (Node.js)
- It can be used frontend (React.js, Vue.js, Tensorflow.js)
- Variables and functions need to end with a semicolin `;`

### Logging to console
- `console` can be used to print statements to console using `log()` method
- It can also be used to display warnings, errors and general debugging 

### Variables
- There are several ways you can instantiate variables (`let`, `var`, `const`)
- const does not change and must be assigned a value from its inception
- let can be modified
- var is globally available and for this reason is not recommended
- There are also several types of variables (`str`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`)
- `typeof` can be used to infer the type of a variable

### Properties
- Properties are associated with objects
- They do not have parenthesis unlike functions
- For example a string object has the property `length`, which can be accessed like so; `console.log(string.length);`

### Object Methods
- Methods are usually used to either mutate the object or give some information about the object
- Methods are denoted by the parenthesis `()` following a class object variable

### Arrays
- Arrays can be created using closed brackets of via the `Array` class
- Arrays can contain multiple data types
- Arrays can be nested
- Arrays start at `0` index
- Arrays have many useful built in methods
    - `push()` can append items to the end arrays
    - `pop()` can remove the last item from array
    - `indexOf()` can be used to return the index of an item (it does not return multiple indices)
    - `sort()` can sort an array a-z
    - `reverse()` (not the opposite of `sort()`) can be used to reverse the *order* of an array
